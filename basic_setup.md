# Basic Setup

There are only three things we need to get started with programming and this course:
1. A working system
2. Python 3
3. A text editor

## Python
Python is a great programming language for beginners. 
It is easy to learn/understand and has a plethora of libraries to support various types of work. 
Don't worry if you don't understand what "libraries" exactly mean here. We'll come to it during the course. 
Just think of Python as English language among all the languages in the world - you can get by at most of the places with it. 
It's actually not very different from English in literal sense as well. 
In the last few years, Python has become the defacto programming language for Data Science.

We will work on Python 3 in this course. Python 3 is not very different from Python 2 for our purpose.

Python 3 comes pre-installed on Linux (strongly recommended).
For Windows and Mac users, you can follow this [link](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to download the latest version version of Python 3.
This page usually detects your OS automatically and suggests the latest stable release on the top of the page.

## Text Editor
We will need a text editor to write our code in. Sublime Text 3 is strongly recommended for beginners, as it is a fairly simple tool to use.
You can download it from [Sublime Text website](https://www.sublimetext.com/).

## Operating System
It is highly recommended that you use **Linux** as it is the defacto environment among the programming development community. 
It is much easier to find help for problems on a Linux system than on a Mac or Windows system.

If you don't have/want to natively install Linux on your system, you can create a virtual machine on your Windows or Mac systems and install Ubuntu 16.
1. Download and install [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/).
2. Download [Ubuntu 16.04](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop) (It's free). This should be about 1.5 Gbs iso file.
3. Install [Ubuntu on Virtual Box](https://askubuntu.com/questions/142549/how-to-install-ubuntu-on-virtualbox).
